## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

While continuing to improve my skills in Power BI and develop a more analytical mindset, I created my most advanced project to date â€” a comprehensive **Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard Suite** built using the AdventureWorks dataset.

This project includes **four interconnected dashboards**:
- **Executive Overview**
- **Sales Team Performance**
- **Product Insights**
- **Customer Insights**

The goal was to go beyond basic reporting and deliver a fully interactive, insight-driven solution for decision-makers. It showcases **key performance metrics**, **strategic business insights**, **trend analysis**, and **customer segmentation** â€” all while applying **best practices in dashboard design, data modeling, and storytelling**.
